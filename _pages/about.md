Hello All. I am a Senior Research Scientist at Educational Testing Service (ETS). My research interest includes natural language generation (e.g., conversation, questions, sentence), figurative language analysis, and argument mining. At ETS AI Labs, I lead a team that focuses on text, question, and social conversation generation for the suite of learning apps as well as traditional assessments such as TOEFL. Before, I also worked towards argument and discourse analysis from the GRE/TOEFL essays for automated scoring. 

Previously, I was a Senior Software Engineer at Thomson Reuters Research at NYC, broadly working towards a variety of information retrieval and information extraction projects related to the legal search engine - Westlaw and Reuters news (classification, recommendations).

Before returning to the industry, I did a Ph.D. on exploring the use of contextual knowledge or pragmatics especially for figurative language, such as sarcasm as applied to social media platforms. I also did a Postdoc at the Brain and Cognitive Sciences Department at MIT, on learning how semantic knowledge is represented in the brain. 

I am an organizer of the biennial FigLang Workshop (e.g.,NAACL 2024); do consider submitting your stellar work on figurative language analysis to the workshop!
